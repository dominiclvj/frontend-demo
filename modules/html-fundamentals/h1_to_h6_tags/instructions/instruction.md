## Learning
Headings are one of the most important elements in HTML. They define the structure of your page, making it easier for both people and search engines to understand the content.
- ```<h1>``` is the main heading — it should describe the overall topic of the page.
- ```<h2>``` through ```<h6>``` are subheadings — they organise content into sections and subsections, like an outline.

Headings are important for many reasons:
- **Readability** - Visitors can quickly scan a page to find what they want.
- **Accessibility** - Screen readers use headings to help visually impaired users navigate.
- **SEO** - Search engines give more weight to headings when deciding what your page is about.
- **Structure** - Headings create a logical hierarchy that keeps your HTML tidy.

For example:
```html
<h1>The Benefits of Cold Showers</h1>

<p>Cold showers have been practised for centuries and are linked to many health benefits.</p>

<h2>Improves Circulation</h2>
<p>Cold water causes blood to move to your vital organs, improving circulation.</p>

<h2>Boosts Mood</h2>
<p>Cold showers can trigger endorphin release, making you feel energised.</p>

<h3>Morning Routine Tip</h3>
<p>Even a 30-second blast of cold water can help you wake up faster.</p>
```

Let's experiment with adding some subheadings to our website.
