# Divs

## Learning
As your web pages grow larger, you need a way to organise different parts of the content. That’s where the ```<div>``` tag comes in. The word “div” is short for division. The tag creates a container, or box, that groups together other HTML elements.

Think of a ```<div>``` like a cardboard box. You can place different items inside the box, and then move or decorate the whole box as one. In the same way, you can place text, images, lists, or even other divs inside when building a webpage. This makes it much easier to control layout and styling, because instead of applying CSS to each element separately, you can apply it to the container and have it affect everything inside.

By default, a ```<div>``` doesn’t change how content looks. It’s an invisible wrapper. But when you combine it with CSS, it becomes very useful. You can give it a background colour, a border, padding, margins, or even position it on the page. Designers often use these elements to break up a page into sections such as a header, a sidebar, or a footer.

In the accompanying example, we have applied a background colour so you can clearly see the two paragraphs it contains. The second ```<div>``` has a border, so it looks like a box around the content.

Let's add another section using these tags and add some formatting.
