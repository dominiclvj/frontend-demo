# Paragraphs

## Learning
The ```<p>``` tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph. Itâ€™s the main way to add blocks of text to your webpage. Browsers automatically add some spacing before and after each paragraph, making your content easier to read.

Why are paragraphs important?
- **Readability** - Paragraphs break up text into digestible chunks. Nobody wants to scroll through a wall of words.
- **Structure** - Just like a book uses chapters, subheadings, and paragraphs, a webpage needs structure so readers can quickly find what they need.
- **Accessibility** - Screen readers (used by visually impaired users) rely on proper tags to announce content correctly.
- **SEO** - Search engines expect your main blocks of text to be inside ```<p>``` tags. If you misuse heading tags to hold your main content, search engines may misinterpret your page and rank it lower.

To summarise, you should use paragraphs to hold the main text content of your website. Paragraphs should sit under the heading tags for titles and subheadings that introduce sections. 

Don't use heading tags to make text look big, only use them for structure. Make sure to break long content into multiple paragraphs for easier reading.
