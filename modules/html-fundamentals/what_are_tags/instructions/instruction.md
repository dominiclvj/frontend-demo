# What Are Tags?

## Learning
Tags are elements used to structure and define the content within an HTML document.

Each tag consists of a pair of angle brackets ```<>``` which are used to mark the beginning and end of an element. The opening tag contains the name of the element, while the closing tag includes a forward slash ```/``` before the element name.

Here's a basic breakdown of how HTML tags work:
- **Opening Tag** ```<tagname>``` - This marks the beginning of an HTML element
- **Closing Tag** ```</tagname>``` - This marks the end of an HTML element
- **Content** - This is what sits between the opening and closing tag (i.e. text and other content elements you want to display on your website)

For example:
```html
<h1>This is a H1 heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<img>This should contain a URL for embedding images</img>
```

Let's edit the open HTML file and make some simple edits using existing tags and some new ones that we'll create.
