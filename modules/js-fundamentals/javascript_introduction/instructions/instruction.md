# Hello World!
Welcome to a frontend development demo built with [Teachstack](https://www.teachstack.io). This covers basic JavaScript. The first three lessons are unskippable. After that you can move through lessons at your leisure.

While this is a relatively simple course, our platform allows the integration of more complex programming languages, including Java, Rust and C++. We can also integrate various database technologies, such as SQL and MongoDB.

Please get in touch with any feedback by emailing dominic.jackson@teachstack.io, or using the [contact form](https://teachstack.io/contact) on our website.
